This chapter (84) is appropriate as it covers machinery and mechanical appliances, specifically those related to aviation. The second choice, HS Code 8411.11.00, pertains to turbo-jets with a thrust not exceeding 25 kN, which is relevant but less specific than the first choice. The third choice, HS Code 8411.12.00, relates to turbo-jets with a thrust exceeding 25 kN, which again is relevant but does not match the specificity of the first option.",

This code is specific to roses and meets the requirement for maximum specificity. The second option, HS Code 0603, is broader and encompasses all cut flowers, which makes it less precise than the first choice. The third option, HS Code 0602.40.00, refers to roses in general, whether grafted or not, but does not specifically address the 'fresh cut' aspect, making it less suitable than the first two options.",

This code is highly relevant due to its focus on optical lenses used for vision correction. The second choice, HS Code 9001.40, pertains specifically to spectacle lenses made of glass, which is a narrower category but still relevant. However, it is less inclusive than the first choice. The third option, HS Code 9004.90.20, refers to prismatic eyeglasses for reading, which is somewhat related but does not match the primary function of prescription lenses as closely as the first two options.

      "reasoning": "The top choice is HS Code 3102.10, which specifically refers to 'Urea, whether or not in aqueous solution.' This code is the most precise for the product 'chemical fertilizer urea' as it directly identifies urea as the main ingredient, aligning perfectly with the product description. The second choice, HS Code 3102.80.00, describes mixtures of urea and ammonium nitrate but is less specific as it includes additional components that may not be present in the product. The third option, HS Code 3102, is a broader category for nitrogenous fertilizers and lacks the specificity required for accurate classification.

The second choice, HS Code 1105.10.00, while also relevant as it encompasses various types of flour including wheat flour, is slightly less specific.
